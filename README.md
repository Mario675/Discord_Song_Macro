# Discord_Song_Macro

- A function that makes the creation of discord songs easy.

## How to make your discord song

- Use the function `arrow_loop(arrow, amount, delay)` to program your note.

- You may put your melodies into a class, to easily organize them. This allows you to play each bar of the melody, without clogging up space. See example in script.
